## Detailed Technical Analysis

### TypeScript Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive type definitions in `/src/lib/hex/types.ts`

- Zero `any` types in implementation
- Clean module boundaries with barrel exports

**Evidence:**

```typescript
export interface Layout {
  orientation: Orientation;
  size: number;
  origin: { x: number; y: number };
}

export interface Axial {
  q: number;
  r: number;
}
export interface Cube {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;

  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

```typescript
export const AppAPI = {
  hex: {
    fromPoint,
    toPoint,
    round,
    distance,
    neighbors,
    diagonals,
    ring,
    range,
    line,
    axialToCube,
    cubeToAxial,
  },
} as const;
```

### Test Quality Assessment ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Unit Test Excellence:**

- Edge case coverage (zero-length lines, empty rings)

**Integration Test Quality:**

- Full pointer‚Üíhex routing simulation
- Canvas mocking with proper DOM setup
- Store state validation across orientations
- Graceful degradation testing

**Coverage Analysis:**

```
lib/hex directory: 98.83% lines, 88.23% branches
