## Visual Design

### Layout Structure

**Five-Area Professional Layout:**
- **Header (60px):** Application branding + integrated toolbar + user controls
- **Scene Panel (280px default, 200-400px range/48px collapsed):** Collapsible and resizable left sidebar for project structure and layers
- **Canvas Area (flexible):** Tabbed central workspace with maximum adaptability
- **Property Panel (320px default, 250-450px range/48px collapsed):** Collapsible and resizable right sidebar for context-sensitive controls
- **Status Bar (32px):** Contextual information and system feedback

**Grid System:**
- 16px base spacing unit for consistent alignment
- 8px micro-spacing for form controls and compact elements
- 20px macro-spacing for major layout separations
- Responsive breakpoint: 1400px (auto-collapse property panel below this width)

### Visual Hierarchy

**Typography Scale:**
- H1 (18px, 600 weight): Application title and primary navigation
- H2 (14px, 600 weight): Panel headers and section titles  
- H3 (13px, 600 weight): Subsection headings
- Body (14px, 400 weight): Form labels and primary text
- Small (12px, 400 weight): Status bar and metadata
- Micro (11px, 400 weight): Helper text and annotations

**Color Strategy:**
- Professional dark theme optimized for long editing sessions
- High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum) for accessibility compliance
- Context-sensitive accent colors: Blue for terrain, Green for text, Purple for features
- Subtle borders and backgrounds to define areas without competing with map content

**Visual Weight Distribution:**
- Canvas area receives maximum visual priority when content is present
- Panels fade into background through neutral colors and minimal decoration
- Active selections and current context receive clear visual emphasis
- Toolbar integration maintains professional aesthetic without distraction

### Component Behavior

**Panel States:**
- **Expanded:** Full width with complete functionality and clear information hierarchy
- **Collapsed:** Icon-only view with tooltips, maintaining essential access
- **Auto-collapse:** Intelligent responsive behavior based on screen width
- **Resizable:** Drag-to-resize panels with visual resize handles and constraints
- **Smooth transitions:** 200ms easing for panel state changes

**Tab Management:**
- Browser-style tabs with close buttons and overflow handling
- Visual active state with subtle highlighting
- Drag and drop tab reordering for workflow optimization
- Middle-click to close, keyboard navigation support

**Resize Handle Design:**
- **Visual Indicator:** 4px wide vertical resize handle on panel borders
- **Hover State:** Handle highlights with subtle background change and resize cursor  
- **Active State:** Visual feedback during drag with live preview of panel dimensions
- **Constraints:** Visual resistance near minimum/maximum width boundaries
- **Double-click:** Snap-to-default animation with visual feedback

**Context Adaptation:**
- Property panel header and content adapt to current selection
- Color coding for different element types (terrain, text, features)
- Synchronized selection highlighting across all panels
- Intelligent form grouping based on element context

## Interaction Patterns

### Primary Actions

**Panel Management:**
- Single-click collapse/expand icons for immediate panel control
- Drag-to-resize via resize handles on panel edges with cursor feedback
- Double-click resize handle to snap to default panel width
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1/2) for power user efficiency
- Hover states on collapse icons and resize handles to indicate interactive areas
- Visual feedback for panel state changes and resize operations
- Minimum and maximum width constraints to maintain usable interface

**Multi-Document Navigation:**
- Tab-based document switching with visual active states
- Ctrl+Tab cycling for keyboard-centric workflows
- New tab creation via + button or Ctrl+T shortcut
- Tab overflow handling with scroll indicators

**Element Selection:**
- Click to select with visual feedback across all interface areas
- Drag selection for multiple elements with preview rectangle
- Escape key to clear selection and return to neutral state
- Context-sensitive cursor changes to indicate current tool mode

### Navigation Flow

**Efficient Workflow Patterns:**
1. **Focus Mode:** Both panels collapsed for maximum canvas space
2. **Management Mode:** Scene panel open for layer/project navigation  
3. **Editing Mode:** Property panel open for detailed element adjustment
4. **Full Mode:** Both panels open for comprehensive project overview

**Keyboard Shortcuts for Power Users:**
- `Ctrl+1`: Toggle scene panel visibility
- `Ctrl+2`: Toggle property panel visibility
- `Ctrl+Shift+1`: Reset scene panel to default width
- `Ctrl+Shift+2`: Reset property panel to default width
- `Ctrl+T`: New map tab
- `Ctrl+W`: Close current tab
- `Ctrl+Tab`: Next tab
- `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`: Previous tab
- `Escape`: Clear selection / exit current mode

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Essential functions always visible in header toolbar
- Secondary functions revealed through panel expansion
- Advanced options available through right-click contexts
- Quick actions shown when panels are collapsed

### Feedback & States

**Real-time Visual Feedback:**
