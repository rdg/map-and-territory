# Correlation Report: Core Campaign Actions

- Aligns with ADR-0002: Commands-first UI binding and declarative manifests; introduces minimal `AppAPI` as the stable surface.
- Terminology alignment: adopt "Campaign" across API/docs and avoid "Project" naming in new surfaces (pending follow-up ADR update).
- Matches `guidance/feature/plugin-toolbar-contract` for group naming and button semantics (group `campaign` proposed).
- E2E selectors will be updated once labels are finalized.
- Conforms to `implementation_standards.md` on Platform-First MVP (typed interface seam + one concrete use).
