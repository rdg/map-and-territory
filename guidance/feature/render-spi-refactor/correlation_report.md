## Summary

- The three artifacts align on scope (move scene/env/tools to plugins), no backward compatibility, and parity‑first delivery. Acceptance criteria are traceable to code touch points.

## Findings

- Level consistency: ok (Level 2 across documents)
- Scope symmetry: ok (same in/out across docs)
- AC traceability: ok (each AC maps to a task and design element)
- Naming/versioning: ok (SPI named Render SPI; ticket T‑RENDER‑SPI)
- Interfaces/contracts: ok (types and registries explicitly listed)
- Risks/assumptions: ok (perf, bundler safety captured)

## Post‑Implementation Notes

- Grid invariant enforced by core EnvProvider in `plugin/loader.ts` (prio -100). This removes host fallbacks and reduces race conditions at bootstrap.
- Tests augmented with alignment regression suite (`src/test/alignment.test.ts`).

## Go/No-Go

- Status: clear
