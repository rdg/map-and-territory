# Creative Layout â€“ Phase 2 Implementation Report

- Feature: guidance/feature/creative-layout-phase-2.md
- Complexity: Level 3 (Complex)
- Orchestration Workflow: guidance/process/orchestration_workflows.md (Complex Features)
- Implementation Process Reference: guidance/process/nextjs_typescript_feature_implementation.md

## Summary

Phase 2 implementation is integrated. Header and toolbar span full width, scene and properties panels are collapsible and resizable with widths persisted, and a status bar is added at the bottom. State is centralized in the layout store with narrow selectors to minimize re-renders.

## Code Mapping

- Header: `src/components/layout/app-header.tsx` (simplified creative header, full-width)
- Toolbar: `src/components/layout/app-toolbar.tsx` (store-driven tool state, panel toggles)
- Layout: `src/components/layout/app-layout.tsx` (PanelGroup with resizers; status bar integration)
- Scene Panel: `src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` (full collapse via store; returns null when closed)
- Properties Panel: `src/components/layout/properties-panel-simple.tsx` (store-driven visibility)
- Status Bar: `src/components/layout/status-bar.tsx` (tool, mouse, selection info)
- Store: `src/stores/layout/index.ts` (panel widths, statusBarVisible, mousePosition, selectionCount + actions, persistence)

## Deviations and Rationale

- Resizer min/max constraints use percentage-based bounds in layout for UX responsiveness; store enforces pixel min/max to match guidance. This keeps layout flexible while persisting concrete values.
- Properties panel animation uses `transition-all` with fixed width container for now; can be changed to `translate-x` if we want an off-canvas feel. Kept simple to reduce motion bugs during QA.
- Optional `use-resize-observer` not added; not currently required.

## Quality & Testing

- Vitest runs unit/integration tests, but currently fails due to Playwright e2e files being collected by Vitest (runner conflict). Action: exclude `src/test/e2e/**` in `vitest.config.ts` or move e2e to `/e2e` with its own Playwright config. See tickets.

## Next Actions (Delegated)

- Polish animations and align exact min/max constraints
- Resolve test runner overlap and run full suite (unit+e2e)
- Add hover/active styling for resize handles per design

## Decision Log

- Retained shadcn/ui SidebarProvider but layered custom store-driven visibility for full hide/show. Keeps idiomatic API while achieving creative-tool UX.
- Integrated `react-resizable-panels@^3` to align with current ecosystem and props.
