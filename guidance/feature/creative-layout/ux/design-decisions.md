# Design Decisions: Creative Layout

## Design Thinking Process

### Empathy: User Research Insights and Pain Points
**From Current Learnings:**
- Users felt overwhelmed by enterprise-focused navigation (Dashboard, Analytics, Users, Roles)
- Interface tone felt wrong for creative TTRPG hobbyists
- Complex hierarchical navigation created cognitive overhead
- Creative flow was interrupted by business-oriented UI patterns

**User Mental Models:**
- Expect creative tool patterns like Photoshop/Affinity Designer
- Think in terms of "tools" and "properties" not "navigation" and "data"
- Value efficiency and flow over comprehensive feature display
- Want interface to fade into background during creative work

**Key Insights from Personas:**
- Game Masters need atmospheric map creation without artistic skill barriers
- Content Creators need professional output with gritty aesthetic control
- All users value atmosphere over precision and prefer analog aesthetics
- Professional UI should enhance rather than conflict with gritty map content

### Define: Problem Statement and User Needs
**Core Problem:** The current enterprise-focused layout interrupts creative flow and misaligns with TTRPG creative tool expectations.

**User Needs:**
1. **Immediate Tool Access:** Creative tools within one click, no navigation drilling
2. **Canvas Primacy:** Map content takes visual priority over UI chrome
3. **Flexible Workspace:** Panels that adapt to current creative task requirements
4. **Creative Flow Preservation:** Interface never interrupts the creative process
5. **Professional Quality:** Clean, reliable interface that builds user confidence

### Ideate: Design Approach and Alternatives Considered

**Chosen Approach: Three-Zone Creative Layout**
- **Zone 1:** Scene view sidebar (collapsible) - hierarchical map organization
- **Zone 2:** Full-width header + horizontal toolbar - immediate tool access
- **Zone 3:** Properties panel (collapsible) - context-sensitive editing

**Alternative Approaches Rejected:**
1. **Floating Panels:** Too chaotic for structured creative work
2. **Tabbed Interface:** Hides important context during creative tasks
3. **Single Sidebar:** Not enough space for both scene navigation and properties
4. **Modal Properties:** Interrupts workflow with popup dialogs

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Toolbar uses icons not text - faster recognition, cleaner appearance
- Panel toggles bookend the toolbar - clear spatial relationship
- Full-width header - professional application feel
- Collapsible panels - workspace adapts to current task needs

### Test: How Design Will Be Validated
**Usability Validation:**
- Time-to-tool measurement (should be <2 seconds for any tool)
- Creative session flow analysis (minimal UI-caused interruptions)
- Panel usage patterns (do users find optimal layouts?)
- Keyboard shortcut adoption rates

**Aesthetic Validation:**
- Interface tone alignment with creative tool expectations
- Visual hierarchy effectiveness (canvas vs. UI priority)
- Professional quality perception from target personas

## Systems Impact

### Existing Patterns
**Maintains Consistency With:**
- shadcn/ui component library visual patterns
- Desktop application layout conventions
- Professional creative tool paradigms
- Accessibility standards and keyboard navigation

**Breaks From Previous:**
- Eliminates enterprise navigation hierarchy
- Removes business-oriented content sections
- Simplifies from complex nested state management
- Abandons "professional enterprise" tone

### New Patterns Introduced
**Creative Tool Selection Pattern:**
- Icon-based toolbar with visual state management
- Contextual cursor changes
- Properties panel integration with tool selection

**Adaptive Panel System:**
- Smooth slide animations for panel toggles
- Canvas width adjustment with panel state
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- State persistence across sessions

**Context-Sensitive Properties:**
- Properties panel content changes based on selection
- Tool-specific option presentation
- Real-time canvas updates from property changes

### Consistency Considerations
**Design System Integration:**
- Uses shadcn/ui components for all UI elements
- Maintains consistent spacing and typography
- Follows established color and interaction patterns
- Preserves accessibility features

**Cross-Feature Coherence:**
- Layout system works with future plugin architecture
- Export workflows integrate smoothly
- Multi-document support accommodated in design
- File operations feel natural within creative layout

### Scalability Implications
**Future Feature Support:**
- Plugin panels can integrate into sidebar system
- Additional tools fit naturally into horizontal toolbar
- Layer system complexity supported by scene panel design
- Export options integrate without layout disruption

**Performance Considerations:**
- Panel animations use CSS transforms for smooth 60fps
- Scene hierarchy optimized for large map structures
- Properties panel updates debounced to prevent flicker
- Canvas resizing handled efficiently without redraws

## Human-Centered Considerations

### Mental Models Alignment
**Creative Tool Paradigm:**
- Users expect tool selection, property editing, and canvas focus
- Spatial relationship between tools and properties feels natural
- Panel management matches expectations from other creative software
- Keyboard shortcuts follow industry conventions

**TTRPG Context Integration:**
- Scene hierarchy matches how users think about map organization
- Layer concepts align with how maps are conceptually structured
- Atmospheric effect controls feel integrated with creative process
- Export workflow matches preparation for game sessions

### Cognitive Load Management
**Information Architecture:**
- Essential tools immediately visible, secondary tools discoverable
- Properties contextual to selection reduces cognitive switching
- Panel collapse eliminates visual noise when not needed
- Clear visual hierarchy prevents information competition

**Interaction Simplicity:**
- One-click tool access minimizes decision fatigue
- Panel toggles provide binary choices (open/closed)
- Properties update in real-time reducing mental model updates
- Consistent interaction patterns across all interface elements

### Error Prevention
**Design Safeguards:**
- Active tool state clearly indicated to prevent wrong-tool usage
- Panel state visually obvious to prevent user confusion
- Properties grouped logically to prevent accidental modifications
- Undo/redo integration provides safety net for property changes

**Graceful Error Recovery:**
- Invalid property values reset to last valid state
- Panel toggle failures provide clear feedback
- Tool selection errors default to safe select tool
- Loading failures provide retry options

### Inclusive Design Considerations
**Motor Accessibility:**
- 44px minimum click targets for all interactive elements
- Panel resize handles (if implemented) provide adequate grab area
- Tool icons sized for users with limited dexterity
- Keyboard alternatives for all mouse interactions

**Cognitive Accessibility:**
- Consistent spatial layout reduces cognitive mapping effort
- Tool tooltips provide context without overwhelming interface
- Properties organized in logical, predictable groups
- Visual state indicators clear and unambiguous

**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast mode support for all interactive elements
- Panel borders provide clear visual separation
- Focus indicators meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Tool states distinguishable without color dependence

## Strategic Alignment

**Product Vision Alignment:**
- Interface fades into background enabling focus on map creation
- Professional tool quality builds user confidence
- Creative workflow optimization matches hobbyist use patterns
- Gritty map aesthetic enhanced rather than competed with by clean UI

**Technical Learning Goals:**
- Complex state management patterns in panel coordination
- Modern React patterns in tool selection and properties
- Professional UI development in creative application context
- Performance optimization in responsive layout system

**Community Building Potential:**
- Interface approachable for TTRPG community members
- Professional quality encourages sharing and collaboration
- Plugin architecture consideration enables community contributions
- Export quality supports content creator workflows
