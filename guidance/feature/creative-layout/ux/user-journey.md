- Extended creative workflows (30min-2hr sessions)
- Iterative map building with frequent tool switching
- Reference to layers and properties while painting hexes

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Creative Session Entry
**User State:** Ready to create/continue map work; mental model shifts from "file management" to "creative mode"
**Actions:** 
- Opens application or existing project
- Scans interface to orient to current map state
- Identifies needed tools for current creative task
- Adjusts workspace layout for optimal creativity

**System Response:** 
- Clean, uncluttered interface prioritizes map canvas
- Scene view sidebar shows current map structure clearly

- Layout adapts to user's panel preferences

**Pain Points:** 
- Interface feels too "businessy" or enterprise-focused
- Too many irrelevant navigation options
- Can't quickly access core creative tools
- Workspace doesn't feel conducive to creative flow

### Stage 2: Active Map Creation
**User State:** In creative flow; rapidly switching between tools and making iterative adjustments
**Actions:** 
- Toggles between scene view and full canvas frequently

- Adjusts properties of selected elements
- References layer structure while working
- Uses keyboard shortcuts for efficiency

**System Response:** 
- Smooth panel collapse/expand animations
- Instant tool switching without interface lag
- Properties panel updates contextually based on selection
- Visual feedback confirms tool states and selections
- Interface stays out of the way of creative process

**Success Criteria:** 
- User maintains creative flow for extended periods
- Tool switching feels natural and immediate
- Properties adjustments feel integrated with creative process
- User focuses on map content, not interface mechanics

### Stage 3: Review and Refinement
**User State:** Stepping back to evaluate overall map; making final adjustments and preparing for export
**Actions:** 
- Collapses panels to see full map view
- Reviews different layers and their interactions
- Makes final property adjustments
- Tests different zoom levels and views
- Prepares for save/export workflow

**System Response:** 
- Clean full-canvas view without UI clutter
- Easy access to view controls and zoom options
- Layer visibility controls remain accessible
- Export options integrate smoothly into workflow

**Pain Points:** 
- Can't get clean view of complete map
- Layer management feels disconnected from creative process
- Export workflow breaks creative momentum

## Key User Mental Models

### Creative Tool Paradigm
Users expect interface patterns from creative applications:
- **Tool Selection:** Click tool, cursor changes, click/drag to use
- **Panel Management:** Collapsible panels that remember state
- **Property Editing:** Context-sensitive properties for selected objects
- **Layer Organization:** Visual hierarchy with show/hide controls

### Hexmap Editor Specific Patterns
- **Hex Grid Focus:** Grid is primary interaction surface
- **Terrain Painting:** Brush-like interaction for hex modification
- **Scene Organization:** Hierarchical view of map elements
- **Atmospheric Effects:** Layered approach to gritty aesthetics

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Creative Flow Maintenance:** Interface never interrupts the creative process
2. **Tool Accessibility:** Essential tools always within one click
3. **Canvas Primacy:** Map content takes visual priority over UI chrome
4. **Efficient Workflows:** Common tasks feel streamlined and natural
5. **Professional Quality:** Clean, reliable interface builds user confidence
