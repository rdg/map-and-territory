- **Bundle Size Impact:** Monitor bundle size, implement code splitting for non-critical paths

### User Experience Risks  
- **Learning Curve:** Provide contextual help, onboarding tours, and keyboard shortcut guides
- **Workflow Disruption:** Maintain familiar patterns where possible, gradual feature introduction
- **Accessibility Regression:** Comprehensive accessibility testing, screen reader validation
- **Mobile Usage:** Ensure graceful degradation even though desktop is primary target

### Integration Risks
- **Existing Component Conflicts:** Thorough testing with existing shadcn/ui components
- **Route Handling Changes:** Comprehensive testing of all application routes and navigation
- **State Management Migration:** Careful migration strategy with data validation and fallbacks
- **Third-party Integration Impact:** Test all external integrations with new layout system
