# Guidance Index

This folder aggregates product, tech, and process guidance. Documents are MECE and link to a single source of truth per topic.

- Product: `product_brief.md`
- Tech: `tech_stack.md`
- Process: `process/AGENTS.md`
- Decisions: `adrs/`
- Features: `feature/`

Editing rules

- Keep docs concise and reference existing sources; do not duplicate standards or testing rules.
- Prefer linking to `process/implementation_standards.md`, `process/testing_standards.md`, or `process/nextjs_typescript_feature_implementation.md` when relevant.
