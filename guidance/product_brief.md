# Map&Territory Product Brief

**Product Type:** Hexmap Editor for TTRPGs  
**Status:** Learning Project  
**Date:** September 2, 2025

## What We're Building

Map&Territory is a hexmap editor for creating atmospheric maps for tabletop RPGs, especially games like Mörk Borg and Death in Space. This is a hobbyist side project focused on learning modern web development patterns while building something genuinely useful for the TTRPG community.

The core concept: **professional content editing tools** that produce **gritty, analog-style maps**. Think Affinity Designer's clean interface but for creating maps that look like weathered artifacts from dark fantasy worlds.

## Design Philosophy

**Visual Aesthetic:** Gritty, analog, hand-drawn feeling inspired by Mörk Borg and Death in Space. Maps should feel like discovered artifacts - distressed, atmospheric, with ink splatters and weathered textures.

**UI Aesthetic:** Professional content editing application. Clean, efficient interface that doesn't compete with the map content. Think Adobe/Affinity tools - the UI fades into the background so you can focus on creation.

**Core Tension:** The interesting design challenge is this duality - a polished, professional interface for creating intentionally rough, gritty content.

## Who Might Use It

**Game Masters** who want to create atmospheric hex maps for dark fantasy/horror campaigns without needing artistic skills.

**Content Creators** making zines, modules, or indie TTRPG materials who need maps with authentic analog aesthetics.

**Players** who want to contribute to worldbuilding or reference evocative maps during gameplay.

## Aesthetic References

**Map Style Inspiration**
- **Mörk Borg**: Distressed textures, ink splatters, weathered parchment, high contrast
- **Death in Space**: Gritty sci-fi aesthetics, worn metal textures, analog decay
- **General Analog Feel**: Hand-drawn imperfections, coffee stains, torn edges, smudged ink

**UI Style Inspiration**
- **Professional Content Tools**: Affinity Designer, Adobe Creative Suite, Figma
- **Clean & Efficient**: Interface fades into background, focus on content creation
- **Power User Friendly**: Keyboard shortcuts, customizable panels, efficient workflows

The contrast between polished UI and gritty map content creates an interesting design challenge and learning opportunity.
