Render Pipeline (Overview)

- SceneFrame is constructed in the UI (CanvasViewport) from store state (size, paper, camera, layers, palette).
- A render service receives resize + frame messages and drives a backend:
  - Worker service (src/render/service.ts + src/render/worker.ts): uses OffscreenCanvas and a dedicated thread.
  - Test-only fallback service (src/render/fallback.ts): wraps the same backend on an HTMLCanvasElement for jsdom tests.
- Backend (src/render/backends/canvas2d.ts): orchestrates drawing and delegates visuals to layer adapters.

Key points

- Single source of truth: the backend calls getLayerType(layer.type).adapter.drawMain(ctx, state, env) for each visible layer (bottom â†’ top).
- The backend computes screen-space layout once per frame:
  - paperRect via computePaperRect (src/render/env.ts).
  - grid hint via deriveGridHint for adapters that align to the grid.
- The Paper adapter draws the paper fill; the backend draws only a simple paper outline.

Worker vs. Fallback

- In development/production, the app uses the worker exclusively and halts if unsupported.
- In tests (NODE_ENV=test), CanvasViewport initializes the fallback service so unit/integration tests can assert against a drawn canvas in jsdom.

Debugging

- The canvas element exposes data attributes during worker init (stage, error) and a small overlay can be enabled with NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=renderer.
